Pandas Module
In this module I will be doing the analysis of district-wide standarized test results. This will help schools make decisions on the future school budgets and priorities.
  
  
This will be done by:
    *A district summary
    
    *A school summary
    
    *Highest-Performing Schools
    
    *Lowest-Performing Schools
    
    *Math Scores by Grade
    
    *Reading Scores by Grade
    
    *Scores by School Spending
    
    *Scores by School Size
    
    *Scores by School Type
